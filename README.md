# Solvency-II

The aim of the project is to compute the BSCR (Basic Solvency Capital Requirement) for an insurance company using different type of risks. For the market risks, we have considered the up-down effect on interest rates and the shock in equity value, shock bond spread. Moreover, in case of life risk, we have observed the effect of the shocks in mortality rates, lapses rates and in case of catastrophic event. We have considered fund composed by AAA corporate zero coupon bond with maturity 10y combined with an equity listed in the regulated markets.
